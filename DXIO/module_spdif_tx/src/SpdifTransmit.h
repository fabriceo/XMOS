 *
 * 1) Desired sample frequency (in Hz)
 *
 * 2) Master clock frequency (in Hz)
 *
 * Then sample pairs:
 *
 * 1) Left sample
 *
 * 2) Right sample
 *
 * The data format is 24-bit signed left aligned in a 32-bit word.
 *
 * If a XS1_CT_END token is received, the thread stops and waits for new sample/master freq pair
