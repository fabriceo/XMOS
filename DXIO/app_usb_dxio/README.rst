Known Issues
............

- On occasion with the build configuration 2i8o8xxxxx_tdm8_slave (or any configuration where the Cirrus CS5368 ADC is used as clock master and the Cirrus CS4364 DAC slaves to this clock) sample-rate changes can cause a channel swapping issue in the Cirrus DAC. This incompatibility is documented in Cirrus note AN302 (https://www.cirrus.com/en/pubs/appNote/AN302REV1.pdf) 

See README in sw_usb_audio for general issues.
