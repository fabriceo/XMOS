can be used in mutiple XC threads, each thread having its own task list and context.

simply invoke the macro XCSchedulerCreateTask(mytask1) for allocating each task  
and then call yield() as much as possible, like in a default select case

it is possible to pass an unsigned parameter to the created task by simply using the other macro: 
XCSchedulerCreateTaskParam( mytask1, value). This is usefull to create multiple instance of a single code, 
where "value" can be used to adjust code behaviour depending on the creator request. 
this "value" is simply passed as an optional parameter (register r0) to the task function.
a second optional parameter is also passed in r1, pointing on the task name (char *)

remark:
-for each xcore thread, a task list is maintained, where the task are appened in the creation order
-for each task created, the stack is allocated once with malloc() based on the compiler nstackwords information.
-if a task ends (reach its end of code) it will be removed from the list, stack is deallocated/free(), 
  and control is passed back to main task, as we do not trust next task context
-yield() instruction imediately stores the current task context and jump to the next one in the list.
 if none, it returns to the yield() of the thread (considered as the maintask).
-it is possible to "yield" for a certain amount of time in cpu cycle with yieldDelay(x)
 this can be compared to a "delay" function where the spare time is given to any other task in the list.
 
 by commenting line 49 of the XCSchedulerYield.s, it is possible to change the behavior of yield():
 instead of going through all teh task in the list, it switch back an forth with the main task.
 ideal to give maximum cpu time to a main select statement.
